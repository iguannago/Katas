#Rules
* Each set is one game
* Scoring system:
1. Each player can have either of these points in one game “love” “15” “30” “40”
2. If you have 40 and you win the point you win the game, however there are special rules:
   1. If both have 40 the players are “deuce”.
   2. If the game is in deuce, the winner of a point will have advantage.
   3. If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game.
   4. If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.
